<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
<br>

## ‚ôæÔ∏è About The Project

Worker-Connect is a comprehensive platform designed to bridge the gap between blue-collar workers and individuals in need of their services. The project offers a user-friendly web application where workers can list their services, showcase their skills through images, and connect with potential clients. The platform includes a price negotiation system and encompasses three key sides: the admin side, worker side, and client side.

Worker-Connect aims to empower blue-collar workers by providing them with a digital platform to showcase their skills, connect with potential clients, and expand their professional opportunities. Simultaneously, the project offers clients a convenient and reliable way to find skilled workers for their specific job requirements. With its user-friendly interface and comprehensive features, Worker-Connect contributes to fostering a collaborative and efficient ecosystem for blue-collar services.
